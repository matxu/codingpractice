// Design a class: set of stacks

/*
Use LinkedList to implement stack, where top is the first node
Set of stacks is a LinkedList, each node stores the pointer to one of the stacks
Push: add one node to the stack pointed by first node. 
If capacity of that stack is reached, create a new stack, and a new node that stores the pointer to the new stack.
Pop: similarlly pop removes the first node of the first stack.

/*Follow up:
popAt(id): pop a specific stack
Index to the id-th stack in linked list
